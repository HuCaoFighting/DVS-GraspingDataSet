# E-Grasping: Robotic Grasping Detectionwith Event-based Camera andEvent-Stream Dataset
a Grasping DataSet Captured by DVS (Dynamic vision sensor)

# Overview
This is the implementation of our recently work 'E-Grasping: Robotic Grasping Detectionwith Event-based Camera andEvent-Stream Dataset'. 
We construct a robotic grasping dataset name E-Grapsing with100  objects.  For  each  object,  there  are4020successive  grasping  annotations  in  different  views  with  atime resolution of1ms. A spatio-temporal mixed particle filter is proposed to track the LED-based grasprectangles which enables video-level annotation of a single grasp rectangle per object. As LEDs blink at highfrequency, the E-Grapsing dataset is annotated in a high frequency of 1 kHz. The original arxiv paper can be found here. The final version will be updated after publication process.
